We’re Now The Date Alchemy
A New Name. The Same Promise.
We’ve rebranded from Betterhalf to The Date Alchemy — and we’d love to tell you why.

Why Did We Change the Name?
As we grow and expand internationally, we needed a brand that better reflects who we are and where we’re headed.

1. A name that fits our future.
We’re now working with singles who are relocating to Mauritius — global professionals who value high-quality, human-centered matchmaking. The Date Alchemy reflects the intention, care, and transformation that define our service.

2. A name that’s uniquely ours.
We previously shared the name Betterhalf with a company in India, with whom we have no affiliation. It was time for something original — a name that captures the magic and meaning behind what we do.

What’s Staying the Same?
Everything you already value:

✅ Same experienced team

✅ Same thoughtful, curated process

✅ Same level of discretion and support

✅ Same pricing (for now)

✅ Same promise: quality introductions with privacy, no pressure, and a deeply human touch

International matchmaking.
