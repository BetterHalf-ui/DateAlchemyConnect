Our Guarantees
First Quality Date Guaranteed Before Payment
Your initial consultation and matchmaking search are completely free. We'll only ask for payment once you say yes to a match and we've planned the first date.

We guarantee at least 4 high-quality introductions within 12 months — or we'll extend your membership at no extra cost. The 12-month period pauses when you start dating someone seriously.

Life happens. If you need to take a break for any reason, we'll pause your membership—no lost time, no penalties.

No Hidden Fees
Transparent pricing. No hidden costs, ever.
