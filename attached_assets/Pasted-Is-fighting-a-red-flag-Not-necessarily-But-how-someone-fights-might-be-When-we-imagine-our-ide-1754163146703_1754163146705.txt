Is fighting a red flag? Not necessarily. But how someone fights might be.



When we imagine our ideal partner, most of us hope for someone calm, kind, and compatible—someone we never really fight with. But as Charles Duhigg explains in his bestselling book Supercommunicators, conflict in a relationship is not only normal—it’s inevitable. In fact, a team of psychologists known as the “Love Shrinks” spent years recording over 1,000 arguments between couples to understand what actually separates happy relationships from unhappy ones. The answer? It wasn’t the presence of fights, but the style of fighting that made all the difference.

Their research revealed that happy couples didn’t necessarily fight about lighter issues or forgive more easily. Many had the same arguments again and again—about parenting, money, or workload—but with one key difference: they fought in a way that protected the relationship. Instead of trying to control their partner, they focused on controlling themselves. Instead of saying “you need to...,” they used “I feel…” statements. They avoided dragging in old arguments or unrelated frustrations—what Duhigg calls “opening new tabs,” like piling more and more browser windows into one conversation until it crashes.

Another major insight from Duhigg’s work is that many conflicts start simply because partners are misaligned on the type of conversation they’re having. One person may just want to vent and feel emotionally heard and validated, while the other quickly switches into problem-solving mode, offering solutions instead of empathy. When that happens, both partners can end up feeling frustrated and unseen. There's actually a hilarious and insightful scene in Modern Family where women explain to Phil Dunphy how he mishandled a conversation with his wife Claire.  It’s funny because it’s true: sometimes, validation is more powerful than advice. Simply understanding this can prevent so many unnecessary fights.

So if you're dating to find a life partner, it’s worth asking: how does this person handle conflict? Because that, more than charm, chemistry, or charisma, is one of the strongest predictors of a relationship that can truly go the distance.
