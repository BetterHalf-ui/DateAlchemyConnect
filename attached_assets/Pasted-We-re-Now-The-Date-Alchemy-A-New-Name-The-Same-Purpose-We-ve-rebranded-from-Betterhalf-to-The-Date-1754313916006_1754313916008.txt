We’re Now The Date Alchemy
A New Name. The Same Purpose.
We’ve rebranded from Betterhalf to The Date Alchemy — and we’d love to tell you why.

Why Did We Change the Name?
As we grow and expand internationally, we felt it was time for a brand that truly reflects our vision and the quality of service we provide.
1. A name that reflects our future.
 We’re working with global professionals in Mauritius and abroad—people who value meaningful, high-quality, human-centered matchmaking.
 The Date Alchemy speaks to the way we’re redefining dating: more respectful, more intentional, more human. It captures the quiet magic of a well-matched connection—and the life-changing transformation that can come from meeting the right person.
2. A name that’s uniquely ours.
 We previously shared the name Betterhalf with a company in India, with whom we have no affiliation. As our reputation and reach grow, we needed a brand that’s distinct, memorable, and entirely our own—one that reflects the care and originality behind what we do.


What’s Staying the Same?
Everything you already value:
Same promise: quality introductions with no pressure, privacy and thoughtful, human support
Same professional team
Same pricing (for now)
