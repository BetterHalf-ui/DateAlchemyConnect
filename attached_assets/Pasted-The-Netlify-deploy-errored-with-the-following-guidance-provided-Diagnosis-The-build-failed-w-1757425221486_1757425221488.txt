The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed with the error message "Command failed with exit code 126: ./build-netlify.sh" due to a permission denied error on line 68.

**Solution:**
1. Verify that the script `build-netlify.sh` has the correct permissions to be executed. You can do this by running `ls -l build-netlify.sh` in the terminal to check the permissions.
2. If the script lacks execution permission, you can grant it using `chmod +x build-netlify.sh`.
3. Make sure to commit the updated script with proper permissions to the repository before triggering a new build.
