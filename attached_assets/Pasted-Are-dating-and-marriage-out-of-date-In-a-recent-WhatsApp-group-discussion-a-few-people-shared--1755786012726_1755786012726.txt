Are dating and marriage "out of date"?


In a recent WhatsApp group discussion, a few people shared a provocative thought: perhaps both dating and marriage are "out of date." They suggested that men and women are "more divided than ever" and that people should instead focus on a "journey back to themselves."

This perspective resonates with a sentiment many of us have encountered at some point: a deep disillusionment with romantic relationships. It's understandable. In a world where we’re constantly exposed to stories of heartbreak and betrayal, and where many of us carry the weight of past relational traumas, it’s easy to lose faith in the idea of shared love.

But a repeated pattern of "bad relationships" often isn't just bad luck. It can be a cycle that we are a part of. 

Are we consistently drawn to partners who are emotionally unavailable? Do we prioritize superficial qualities like looks or wealth over core values and character? 

Attachment theory, one of the most widely recognized frameworks to explain certain dynamics in relationships, offers a powerful way to understand how people can get attracted to the wrong people and get into toxic relationships. 

It says that certain individuals - with an anxious attachment style - have a deep-seated fear of abandonment and a strong desire for closeness, which leads them to constantly seek reassurance and intimacy from their partners. Other individuals - with an avoidant attachment style -, on the other hand, have a fear of being "trapped" or losing their independence, and they tend to pull away when a relationship becomes too close.

This dynamic creates a self-reinforcing cycle. The anxious partner's pursuit of closeness and their need for reassurance can be interpreted by the avoidant partner as a threat to their independence, causing them to withdraw. This withdrawal, in turn, intensifies the anxious partner's fear of abandonment, causing them to pursue even more aggressively. In this cycle, each person's coping mechanism inadvertently triggers the other's core wound. The avoidant partner gets the "space" they crave, and the anxious partner's worst fears of abandonment are confirmed.

What is interesting is that ultimately, they are attracted to each other because they are familiar with this relational dance from their earliest childhood experiences. For the anxious partner, the avoidant's unavailability feels familiar because it mirrors the inconsistent or distant care they might have received. For the avoidant partner, the anxious partner's neediness validates their belief that others are too demanding and that they are better off relying on themselves.

 Recognizing our own attachment style and the types of people we gravitate toward is a crucial step in breaking these cycles and opening ourselves up to healthier possibilities.

Eventually, we can't agree more with the call to "journey back to yourself".  It’s about healing, self-discovery, and understanding our own needs and worth, and sometimes even learning to meet some of our needs by ourselves. However, at the Date Alchemy, we strongly believe that this isn't the final destination. It's a journey that prepares us for a new one—the possibility of a healthy, fulfilling connection with a deserving partner.
