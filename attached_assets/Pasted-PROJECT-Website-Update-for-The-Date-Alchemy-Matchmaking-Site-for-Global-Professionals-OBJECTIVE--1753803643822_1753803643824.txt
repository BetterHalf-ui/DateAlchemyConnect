PROJECT: Website Update for The Date Alchemy (Matchmaking Site for Global Professionals)

OBJECTIVE:
Update the existing website with a refined, high-end structure tailored for two markets (Mauritius & Singapore), following UX and creative direction focused on elegance, discretion, and a transformative dating experience. Use visual and UX references from https://www.fourseasons.com/ and the attached creative brief.

STYLE & BRANDING GUIDELINES:
- Background: Black for the first 3 sections, then alternate White / Earthy tones, and end with Black footer
- Typography: Serif (semi-bold) for titles, clean sans-serif for body text
- Mood: Sophisticated, calm, warm, trust-building — no clichés or stock imagery
- Font, layout, and transitions should reflect high-end hospitality
- Use subtle scroll-triggered animations and fade-ins where appropriate

========
1. HOMEPAGE HERO BANNER
========
- Replace text with: "A Healthy Dating Experience For Global Professionals"
- This text should be invisible on load and fade in on scroll (only slight scroll needed)
- Keep two CTA buttons at bottom:
    - Sign Up
    - Create a Complimentary Profile

========
2. NAVIGATION BAR
========
- Sticky navigation bar with translucent black background and white text
- Left: Menu items → "The Alchemy", "The Alchemists", "Membership & Pricing"
- Right: CTA → "Sign Up Now"
- Nav items must scroll smoothly to relevant sections of the homepage

========
3. SECTION FLOW AND STRUCTURE
========

a. Hero Banner (as above)

b. INTRODUCTION
- Remove image
- Full-width text only:
"Finding a real connection in Mauritius isn't easy — especially when you are a busy professional and hold yourself to high standards. 
At The Date Alchemy, we believe real connections rarely happen by chance. We invite you to put yourself out there, intentionally. And we’ll handle the rest — discreetly, with care, and without the confusion. So you can focus on living fully, while love finds its way to you."
- Add 4 favicon-style icons with these captions:
    1. Handpicked introductions with singles who match your standards
    2. Compatibility based on your needs, not just interests
    3. Curated real-life experiences, not swiping
    4. A human-led process backed by relationship science
