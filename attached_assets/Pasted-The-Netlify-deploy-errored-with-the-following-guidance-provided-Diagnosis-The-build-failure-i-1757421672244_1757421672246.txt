The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to a permission denied error when trying to execute the `./build-netlify.sh` script in the Netlify build environment.

The relevant error lines are:
- [line 71](#L71): `bash: line 1: ./build-netlify.sh: Permission denied`
- [line 73](#L73): `"build.command" failed`
- [line 77](#L77): `Command failed with exit code 126: ./build-netlify.sh && npm run build:functions`

### Solution
1. **Permission Denied Error:**
   - Check the permissions of the `build-netlify.sh` script. It seems that the script does not have executable permission.
   - Make sure to grant executable permission to the script before running it. You can do this by running the following command in the repository:
     ```bash
     chmod +x build-netlify.sh
     ```

2. **Verify Script in Configuration:**
   - If `build-netlify.sh` is not present in the repository, ensure it is added and committed to the repository.
   - Verify that `build-netlify.sh` is included in the build configuration file (like `netlify.toml`) and the correct path is provided.

This should resolve the permission denied error and allow the script to execute successfully during the build process.
