    answer: "Absolutely! We welcome individuals who are divorced or single parents, as long as the separation is legally documented and amicable. If you're ready to begin the next chapter of your life, we're here to assist you. We're upfront about your past with potential matches, so it's not a topic that needs to be discussed during your date."
