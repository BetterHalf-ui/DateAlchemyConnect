# Deploy The Date Alchemy to Netlify - FIXED

## âœ… **Issue Fixed**
The build error has been resolved by updating the build command to include dev dependencies.

## Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

### Via GitHub (Recommended)
1. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.app)
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect your GitHub account and select your repository
4. Netlify will automatically detect the settings from `netlify.toml`
5. Click "Deploy site"

**The build configuration is now fixed:**
- âœ… Build command: `npm ci --include=dev && npm run build`
- âœ… Publish directory: `dist/public`
- âœ… Functions directory: `netlify/functions`

## Step 2: Environment Variables (Optional)
For database features, add in Netlify dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string (if using external database)

## Step 3: Your Live Website
- **Netlify URL**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- **API endpoints**: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app/api/*`

## What's Included
âœ… Complete website with all pages and content  
âœ… Blog system with existing posts  
âœ… Member count (225 active members)  
âœ… Serverless API functions  
âœ… Multilingual support (English/French)  
âœ… All application forms linked properly  

## Simplified Deployment
The Netlify function now uses in-memory data, so your website will work immediately without needing to set up an external database first. You can always add a database later if you want dynamic content management.

**Your Date Alchemy website is ready to deploy!** ðŸš€
